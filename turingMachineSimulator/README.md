# TuringMachineSimulator
A very basic Turing machine simulator. Features a step by step runtime simulator. While the code is extremely messy, this was extremely useful when taking my formal languages course.

## How it works
This porgram behaves as an interpreter. It accepts a file of a very specific format (see the examples) as a input parameter, and simulates the specified turing machine. While it is far form perfect (ie non determiniism is not taken into account), it is a good enogh tool for verifying solutions the theoretical computer science problems.
